# Business Performance Analysis

This project analyzes business financial health by examining debt ratios and profitability metrics. The goal is to identify high-risk companies, clean and structure raw data for analysis, and generate insights at both the company and state level.

## Key Steps

Imported and validated raw business financial data.

Cleaned and normalized data (handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies).

Calculated Debt-to-Income (DTI) and Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratios.

Flagged businesses with negative equity (negative D/E) as high-risk.

Aggregated results to generate state-level descriptive statistics.

Visualized relationships between profitability and leverage.

## Data Pipeline and Flowchart

data_pipeline.py follows the sata_pipeline_flowchart.png
(import → validate → clean → calculate → flag → aggregate → export).

## Decision Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the classification logic used in the Revenue vs. Profit Margin Matrix. It defines thresholds, handles outliers, and shows how businesses are categorized into Stars, Volume Players, Niche Winners, and Strugglers.

The flowchart is generated by the Python script decision_flowchart.py, included in the repository.

The analysis includes a decision flowchart that illustrates how businesses are classified into quadrants (Stars, Volume Players, Niche Winners, Strugglers) based on Revenue and Profit Margin.

## Data Pipeline Outputs

`negative_debt_to_equity_businesses.csv` → list of high-risk businesses with negative equity.

`business_level_with_DTI.csv` → cleaned dataset with DTI calculated for each business.

`state_descriptive_stats.csv` → aggregated financial health indicators at the state level.

## Visualizations

**Revenue vs. Profit Margin — Quadrant Matrix**
Companies are classified into four groups (STARS, VOLUME PLAYERS, NICHE WINNERS, STRUGGLERS) based on revenue and profit margin medians.  
   ![Revenue vs Profit Margin Matrix](figures/revenue_vs_pm_matrix.png)
   
**Stars — Revenue with Profit Portion**
   Highlights top "STAR" companies, showing revenue bars with profit dollars overlaid, including profit margin labels.  
   ![Stars Revenue with Profit Portion](figures/star_businesses.png)

**Average Debt‑to‑Income by State:** Shows the mean DTI for each state and highlights those with higher leverage.

**High Debt‑to‑Income (>50%):** A horizontal bar chart of companies whose DTI exceeds 50%, with an 'X' marking those with negative equity.

**Profit Margin vs. Debt‑to‑Income:** Scatter plot of profitability vs DTI, with a trend line and annotations for companies that have negative equity.

**Risk‑colored Debt‑to‑Income vs. Profit Margin:** Risk quadrants based on medians and an IQR‑based upper fence; points are colored by risk tier (low, medium, high).

**DuPont Analysis – Profit Margin vs. Asset Turnover:** Scatter plot showing how the interaction between profit margin and asset turnover affects return on equity.

**DuPont Analysis – Return on Equity vs. Debt‑to‑Equity:** Illustrates how the capital structure (debt‑to‑equity ratio) relates to return on equity, with a trend line.
