# Business Performance Analysis

This project analyzes business financial health by examining debt ratios and profitability metrics. The goal is to identify high-risk companies, clean and structure raw data for analysis, and generate insights at both the company and state level.

### Key Steps

Imported and validated raw business financial data.

Cleaned and normalized data (handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies).

Calculated Debt-to-Income (DTI) and Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratios.

Flagged businesses with negative equity (negative D/E) as high-risk.

Aggregated results to generate state-level descriptive statistics.

Visualized relationships between profitability and leverage.

### Data Pipeline and Flowchart

The flowchart illustrates the end-to-end data pipeline, moving from raw input to final outputs: import → validate → clean → calculate → flag → aggregate → export.

### Data Pipeline Outputs

`negative_debt_to_equity_businesses.csv` → list of high-risk businesses with negative equity.

`business_level_with_DTI.csv` → cleaned dataset with DTI calculated for each business.

`state_descriptive_stats.csv` → aggregated financial health indicators at the state level.

# Visualizations

### Decision Flowchart

This flowchart outlines the decision logic behind the upcoming Revenue vs. Profit Margin Matrix: it sets thresholds, treats outliers, and classifies businesses as Stars, Volume Players, Niche Winners, or Strugglers. It’s generated by the included decision_flowchart.py script.

### Revenue vs. Profit Margin — Quadrant Matrix

Companies are classified into four groups (Stars, Volume Players, Niche Winners, Strugglers) based on revenue and profit margin medians.

### Risk‑colored Profit Margin vs. Debt-to-Income:

Risk quadrants based on medians and an IQR‑based upper fence; points are colored by risk tier (low, medium, high).
